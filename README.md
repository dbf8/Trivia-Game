# Project-1
## Description
This Project is a trivia game based loosely on the Gameshow Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Questions, in fact, were adpoted (under fair use) from the first winner. Wrong answers display a "try again" piece. It is impossible to not win, wrong answers freeze the functionality and the game cannot move forward without a right answer. Pieces of the code were given fun names.

## Features
I used arrays, objects, functions, and plently of if else statements. ES6 onetime event functionality was also used for initial click/button events. The most difficult piece I had was on the randomizing function which thankfully the internet was extremely helpful with.

In the future I'd like the jury-rigged score system to actually be "proper" but found difficulty with each score being at least somewhat arbitrary as it was based on the gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
