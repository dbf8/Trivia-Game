# Project-1

I created a simple trivia game. It is impossible to not win, wrong answers freeze the functionality and the game cannot move forward without a right answer.

I used arrays, objects, functions, and plently of if else statements. ES6 onetime event functionality was also used for initial click/button events.

The most difficult piece I had was on the randomizing function which thankfully the internet was extremely helpful with.

In the future I'd like the jury-rigged score system to actually be "proper" but found difficulty with each score being at least somewhat arbitrary as it was based on the gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
