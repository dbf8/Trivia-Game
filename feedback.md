Great work overall!  You have a nice looking app and the functionality is all there. You made good use of modern css techniques like grid and flexbox. Your js approach is solid and you made good use of functional programming and dom manipulation. 

The biggest things I'd look into working on would be better ability at handling page resizing (look into media queries for your css). A little bit of cleaning up your js file and perhaps separating your data into a different file would be ideal. Also, html is good and you made good use of class names, however it'd be best if you made use of things like lists, headings, and paragraph tags to make your tags more semantic.
